void solve() {
    string s, t;
    cin >> s >> t;
    for (char ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ++ch) {
        if (s + ch == t) {
            cout << "Yes" << endl;
            return;
        }
    }
    cout << "No" << endl;
}

### Problem B: Easy Linear Programming

**Problem Statement:**

- There are **A** cards with value **1**, **B** cards with value **0** and **C** cards with value **-1**.
- You need to pick up exactly K cards so that the sum of numbers on the cards is maximized.

<details>
<summary>
Hint 
</summary>
<ul>
<li> Try to pick as many as cards with value 1 possible, next with 0 and finally with value -1. </li>
</ul>
</details>

Code
</summary>
{% highlight c++ %}
void solve() {
    ll a, b, c, k;
    cin >> a >> b >> c >> k;

    ll res = 0;
    // pick cards with value 1
    res += min(a, k);
    k -= min(a, k);

    if (k == 0) {
        cout << res << endl;
        return;
    }

    // pick cards with value 0
    k -= min(b, k);
    if (k == 0) {
        cout << res << endl;
        return;
    }

    // pick cards with value -1
    res -= min(c, k);
    k -= min(c, k);
    cout << res << endl;
}

### Problem C: Skill Up

**Problem Statement:**

- There are **M** algorithms, for each of them, you have an understanding level of **0** initially.
- There are **N** books, each of them costing some value, say **C[i]** for i-th book, and by reading the i-th book, the level of understanding of j-th algorithm gets increased by **A[i][j]**.
- You need to make the understanding level of each algorithm greater or equal to **X**.
- Tell whether it is possible to do so by buying some subset of the books and if so, print the minimum cost of books which will achieve it.

**Constraints:**

- $$ 1 \leq N, M \leq 12 $$ 
- $$ 1 \leq X, C[i] \leq 10^5 $$
- $$ 0 \leq A[i][j] \leq 10^5 $$ 

<details>
<summary>
Hints 
</summary>
<ul>
<li> Check the constraints of the values of N and M in the problem statement. </li>
<li> For every book, you have 2 choices to make, either buy it or don't. </li>
<li> Apply standard recursion to check for cost in each possibility, and take the minimum one, and also check that level of understanding for each book must be greater or equal to X in the end! </li>
</ul>

int n, m, x;

        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            if (levels[i] < x) {
                return;
            }
        }
        res = min(res, cost);
        return;
    }
    // don't pick the book
    rec_solve(cur + 1, cost, books, levels);
    // pick the book
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        levels[i] += books[cur].second[i];
    }
    rec_solve(cur + 1, cost + books[cur].first, books, levels);
}

    cin >> n >> m >> x;

    int c;
    vector<pair<int, vector<int>>> books;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {

        for (auto &l: level) {
            cin >> l;
        }
        books.push_back({c, level});
    }

    res = INT_MAX;
    vector<int> levels(m, 0);
    rec_solve(0, 0, books, levels);
    
    if (res == INT_MAX) {
        cout << -1 << endl;
    } else {
        cout << res << endl;
    }

### Problem D: Teleporter

**Problem Statement:**

- You are given an array contains **N** values, each in the range of **1** to **N**, (may not be all distinct).
- You are currently at position 1 in the array. (consider 1-based indexing).
- At each step, if you are position **pos**, you get to **arr[pos]**.
- You need to find out the position where you will be after **K** steps.

**Constraints:**

- $$ 2 \leq N \leq 2 * 10^5 $$ 
- $$ 1 \leq arr[i] \leq N $$
- $$ 1 \leq K \leq 10^{18} $$ 

<details>
<summary>
Hints
</summary>
<ul>
<li> Since K is very large, we cannot simulate the entire process. So there must be some mathematics involved since we just need the final position. </li>
<li> We are at position 1 initially, and in atmost N steps, we will reach a position which is already visited earlier (why?). So, what happens next? </li> 
<li> We will keep on looping over from the start of the cycle, to the same positions visited earlier from the cycle start. </li>
<li> Consider the example <b>arr = [3, 2, 4, 3]</b>. 
    We go from 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3. After this, we will keep on looping between 3 and 4. </li>
<li> See what all do we need to compute the final position after K steps, we will need the start of the cycle and when it is reached (steps) and also the length of the cycle. </li>
<li> We will cover some steps before cycle start, say <b>done</b>, and remaining steps will be <b>k - done</b>. We can find remainder of it when divided by cycle length and then simulate the process that many times to get the final position, see code for details. </li>
</ul>
